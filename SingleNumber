// Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1

class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int result=0;
        for(int num:nums)
        {
            result=result^num;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
